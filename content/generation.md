# Generating Heroes
Below is an outline of how to generate heroes for ***Lambda***.

---

## Choose an [archetype](/lambda/archetypes).
Familiarize yourself with your abilities.

## Select your [equipment](/lambda/equipment/).
Heroes in this game start out poor.
You get ***10 Gold***. Roll a d20. On a 20, you start with ***20 Gold***.

You can spend it on whatever you please, but I'd recommend getting a weapon and spending the rest on equipment.

You probably should save some, too, so you can buy food.

But do whatever you want. If you want to spend it all on that nice, fancy spear, I'm not gonna stop you.

> If you are a Wizard, Magi, or chose the Paladin / Rune Knight fighting style, 
> also mark down your spellcasting equipment. You get that stuff for free. My treat.

## Allocate your attributes.
Distribute these six numbers among your hero's attributes, wherever you want them to go:

## *| 5 | 3 | 1 | 0 | -1 | -3 |*

Choose wisely!

## Finishing touches!
Your ***Speed*** is equal to 30 + (Dexterity * 2). Round down to the nearest 5.

Your ***Armor Class*** with no armor on is equal to 11 + (Dexterity / 2).

Your ***Health*** is equal to your Archetype's base Health + Constitution.
> For convenience, here's the numbers:

> ***| Thief - 7 | Fighter - 13 | Leader - 11 | Wizard - 9 | Magi - 8 |***

Your ***Skill*** is equal to 2 + max(Intelligence, Wisdom) / 2

You can carry an amount of ***Load*** equal to 8 + Strength.

## True Character
Finally, we'll do just the barebones work on who they are.
Remember, we want to discover most of their True Character through play!

Choose a ***Motivation*** for the hero. This is a short phrase of three or less words, which describes their primary urge in life.

> Examples: "Give back", "protect the innocent", "learn", "fight", "deliver justice", "live honestly", "explore", "prove myself".

Finally, give 'em a ***name***!

You should have an interesting character to role-play.

If you don't, let me know, and we'll do it again!
