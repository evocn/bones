# *Lambda*, an RPG Campaign
***Alex Hartford*** | ***Winter 2024***

If I sent you this, you'll want to read the [Proposal](/lambda/proposal/).

You'll also probably want to read the first few paragraphs of the [Setting](/lambda/setting/).

And for all the nitty gritty, here's the [Core Rules](/lambda/rules/).
There are also rules for subsystems above.

I look forward to our adventures together!
