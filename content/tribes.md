#   The Twelve Tribes
# Katalon
The Noble Tribe of the Nafud.
Ever since the early days, since King Katalon, the First of His Name, united the Twelve Tribes under the Crown of the Sun,
to drive back the invaders of the East, the Katalon have ruled the Council of the twelve tribes.

Their lineage is chock full of legends. Sorceresses, great Kings, God-Warriors, and Champions of Men.
Today, the bloodline dwindles, the great City of Katalon sleeps, and dark tidings herald the end of the age of the Nafud.

# Abrash
One of the tribes of the Nafud.
The Abrash were, for a long time, a quiet folk.
They would work with the tribes in matters concerning the Baraza, but they were not travellers by any means.
The host they assembled ten years ago was vast. It remains the primary activity of the Abrash: to conquer.

The Abrash has always hosted its dark feelings towards the tribes.
It has never been blessed with a Sorceress of true blood.
The lands it lies on are the most desolate of all the tribes.
Foul Ash diseases taint the Abrash, killing most in childhood.
For those reasons, the Abrash rely on strength and endurance.
And for those reasons as well, they seek conquest.

# Aqia
The Aqia are not a true-blood tribe, though there are some princes who claim that right.
Instead, it is a loose consolidation of trading powers.

# Victar
A lesser tribe. Known in times of old for spiritual guides and mystics, for many years the Victar have prophecied to deaf ears.
They hold little land or influence, but the Victar rituals are observed in many of the cities of the wastes even now when a man dies or is born.

# Raissa
The Raissa are glorious, even now.
Their wealth is substantial, and their excess is implacable.
The women of Raissa embed jewels in their flesh,
and the men sew gold into their cloaks.

The Citadel of Ash, named for the great dormant volcano beside, is a true sight to behold.

# Thekla
The Great Builders, once. Their methods of combining slag and stone led to all the great structures of the Nafud.
They found materials in the foothills at the end of the world.
The pyramids they built baffle explanation. They are simply too large to imagine construction - for this or any age.

Their current state is unknown. The lands of the Thekla were the first to be swallowed by The Shade.

# Andria
Andria has always been a small tribe of warrior monks.
From their ranks can be counted the most legendary of Nafud heroes.
Mirrah, the Shadow was of Andria, as was Hy-al, Sorcerer Princess of Katalon.
In Andria, men are scarce.

# Terranise
A reclusive people, different from the other tribes.
They reside on a peninsula on the northern coast.
These lands are stormy, swampy, and very different from the deserts to the south.
The people here are agrarian, secretive, and strange.
Some say they came from across the North sea. Others say they are of a different species of man entirely.
Others still believe them to be psychics of some strange magic.

# Ell
Ancestrally untrusting and fearful, this tribe has squandered its once plentiful resources, and now slides inexorably towards destruction.
The only question asked of the Ell is this: Which will take them first? The Shade, or the Famine?

# Ain
The Ain are the southern coastal folk of the Nafud.
Their lands are vast, and they grow fruits and even some grains among the strip of the sea.
They share their lands with the Ashurnabi, a nomadic sailing folk.
The Ain hold the lands, the Ashurnabi sail the seas.

# Ashurnabi
The Ashurnabi are sailers along the southern sea.
The winds are strong and harsh here, and the Ashurnabi are a crafty sort to handle them.

# The Unknown Ones
The tales all speak of Twelve Tribes of the Nafud. That is how it has always been.
But the twelfth tribe, traditionally, is not spoken of.
To some, the Twelfth is the place where a man goes when he dies, to share brotherhood with all Nafud.
To others, the Twelfth is a true tribe, with history which shames the ancestors, and which has fallen.
None are certain.
