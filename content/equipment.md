## Miscellaneous Goods
Here are other things you might spend your coin on:

### Animals
![camel](/lambda/images/camel.jpg)

***Pack animals*** can carry Load for you.

***Mounts*** can carry heroes, increasing your overland travel speed.

Most animals consume supplies at the same rate as a hero.

***Donkey/Mule*** | 8 GP
> A Mule carries up to 8 Load, but is unable to be mounted.
> A Mule travels at a rate of 30 ft.

***Draft Horse*** | 25 GP
> A horse is the mount of choice outside the desert.
> A horse travels at a rate of 40 ft.

***Camel*** | 30 GP
> A camel serves as a mount, as well as a pack animal.
> They can carry up to 4 Load along with a passenger, or otherwise 10 Load.

> A camel travels at a rate of 50 ft., and is able to travel through dune fields, which other mounts and most people cannot.

> Camels are very hardy creatures, and require very little water. Therefore, they require supplies only every other day.

### Vehicles
***Cart*** | 20 GP
> A cart can be pulled by two mules or a draft horse.
> They give up their ability to carry load, but the cart can carry up to three heroes, their equipment, and 10 extra Load, or 40 Load without any heroes.

> A cart cannot travel across rivers, streams, rocky terrain, desert, or swamps.
> In fact, any traversal not on a given road is a risky proposition.

### Services
***Weapon Master*** | A swordsmith, fletcher, or other craftsman will repair, hone, or craft weapons for a fair price.

> Typically, repair costs are proportional to a weapon's value, costing about a third of the weapon's price to repair it.
> A dull weapon is treated as broken, and costs the same as to repair.

> To craft new weapons, a smith typically will charge the usual market value of a weapon, plus a small amount for the services rendered.
