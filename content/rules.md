The Rules System for ***Lambda***.

---

# Priorities
Rubicon is a system which is...
> ***Honest.***
Specialized heroes. Glaring weaknesses. Dump stats matter.
Progression is specific. It is earned, not expected.
Character death is possible, and in many circumstances probable.

> ***Rules-light.***
Tight, simple core mechanic.
Keep dice-rolling to a minimum.
Rulings, not rules.
Small numbers with big consequences.
Simple, to allow for endless customization as a game progresses.

> ***Focused on character specialization.***
Heroes play a specific role.
Party relationships and synergy matter.
Heroes have glaring weaknesses, which they must bolster somehow.
Combat focused on limited resources, Risk-taking, and craftiness.

The game aims at a ***Heroic, Low-Fantasy*** setting.
Fighters wield swords, axes, and longbows, and wear armor into battle.
Magic, a relic of the past, still exists in the artifacts of old and the rare individual touched by a special gift.
Death is close to permanent.
Transportation of goods and adventurers is difficult.
Equipment is valuable, even the plain sword which your character wields.

# Basics
The game is adjudicated using the ***d20***.

All modifiers to checks are based on ***Negotiation***. A player makes their case to the Dungeon Master which modifiers should be added to a particular check.

***Advantage*** and ***Disadvantage*** are used as a basic way to augment checks based on circumstances.

Heroes can move up to their ***Speed*** on their turn.

***Health*** govern a hero's life force and their ability to go on.

***Skill*** govern a hero's ability to perform superhuman feats.

***Armor*** governs how difficult it is to land a solid blow.

***Attributes*** are plain numbers governing a hero's ability to do things.
A hero can have a score from -10 to 10 in any attribute.
There are 6 attributes: ***Strength***, ***Dexterity***, ***Constitution***, ***Intelligence***, ***Wisdom***, and ***Charisma***.

An ***Archetype*** is a specialization of a character's role. Each player character has one archetype.

# Combat
Combat begins when two parties would try to adjudicate against eachother.

![combat](/lambda/images/combat.jpg)

The game has no concept of rolling ***Initiative***.
Who goes first is determined by the circumstance. Usually the heroes act first.
Heroes act in order around the table. They may seat themselves accordingly at the start of each turn. This process must not require DM intervention.

***On Your Turn***, a hero can move and act, in any order.
A hero can use Quick Actions at any time during their turn, or in response to events which apply to that action.

## Actions
A hero ***Attacking*** makes a roll against the victim's armor class, adding their weapon's governing modifier to the roll.
On a hit, they roll a damage die based on the weapon.

A hero can forgo their actions on a turn to try to ***Dodge*** incoming attacks, imposing disadvantage on them.

A hero can try to ***Shove*** an enemy, making an attack roll with their Strength attribute. On a hit, they push their target up to 5 feet.

A hero can move up to their speedE as an action on their turn.

A hero can try to ***Grapple*** with an enemy, holding them in place. To do so, they
must have a free hand. They roll an attack roll against an enemy using their
Strength attribute, and on a hit, they have grappled the enemy.
The enemy cannot move, and tries to escape at the end of their turn.

## Other things that might happen
***Difficult Terrain*** costs twice as much movement to cover.

Some circumstances involve ***Quick Actions***. There are no restrictions on Quick Actions, and a hero can take as many in a row as is necessary or applicable.

You can ***Stow***, ***Equip***, or ***Use*** an item as a quick action on your turn once. More than one item in a turn requires an action.

A hero who rolls a natural 20 to hit with an attack deals a ***Critical Hit!*** They deal the maximum possible damage on the attack, given all modifiers.

A ***Zone*** is just a circular area centered around a point with a radius of 15 feet. It's a simple way to refer to areas in-game.

A creature in ***Cover*** cannot be targeted by a ranged attack.

All attacks against a creature who is ***Prone*** have advantage. A creature must spend half their speed to get up from being prone.

This game has no concept of "Flanking", "Opportunity Attacks", "Partial Cover", or "Hiding" in combat.
These sorts of things either don't exist in the game, or are adjudicated given specific scenarios.

# Heroes
Hero archetypes are outlined on [this page](/lambda/archetypes).

![sage](/lambda/images/sage.jpg)

## Progression
Progression usually comes in the form of items, artifacts, and blessings.

Often, it will be clear to a hero how they may progress, whether it be through the acquisition of a storied weapon,
their God's blessing, the study of ancient texts in battle tactics, or the acquisition of wealth through subterranean expedition.

The Dungeon Master will provide a clear indication of what is required for a hero to progress.

Here are some examples of progression in this system, as it is a confusing concept at first.
* A Fighter saves their coins until they can purchase a suit of Chain Mail, cementing their ability to defend their friends.
* A Magi seeks the ruined temple to their deity. With the help of their friends, they successfully make the pilgrimage, for which their God rewards them with a new power.
* A Wizard finds a dusty tome in the basement of an old northern keep, where once the spells of darkness were practiced. They have the option before them to study dark magic.
* A Thief successfully infiltrates a refined party, pushing their limits and learning some new tricks in the process.
* A Leader guides his party through a series of military conflicts, hardening their skills in the process. They gain a new ability after some much-needed rest.

## Death
A hero reduced below 1 Health is incapacitated.

They may be stabilized by another hero who takes their action to do so.

If not stabilized within 1 minute, they die.

A hero who is stabilized does not return to battle, and regains consciousness after an hour.

## Injury
If stabilized, a hero returns to 1 Health, but must roll on the injury table.
Additionally, all injuries come with some mental or physical mark for a hero to carry with them the rest of their days.

| (d4)| Effect |
|:---:|:------:|
| 1-2 | Lose 1d4 of a random Attribute. |
| 3   | Lose 4 Maximum Health. |
| 4   | All checks have disadvantage for one week. |

## Recovery
In order to regain spent Health and Skill, as well as heal particular status ailments, heroes must rest.
In order to rest, the party must have adequate food and water.

For each night of rest in a comfortable place,  a hero regains half their Health and Skill.

For each night of rest while camping somewhere, a hero regains a quarter of their Health and Skill.

For each night of uncomfortable rest, such as sleeping outside in the rain, a hero regains 2 Health and 1 Skill.

# Equipment
The equipment of the game is outlined on [this page](/lambda/equipment/).

Trade in this setting typically involves the various forms of ***Currency***.

In the Four Kingdoms, the standard coin is the Golden Mark.

The most common coin in the Grey Wastes is the Silver Dirham. Also traded is the more valuable Golden Dinar.
The Dinar is a smaller coin than the Dirham, but is heavier.

As a reference point, most people will trade 10:1 between Silver Dirham and Golden Dinar.
Between the Four Kingdoms and the Grey Wastes, the Golden Mark usually trades one-to-one for the Dinar, but not all merchants will accept this.
The two coins have nearly the same weight, however.

These coins are forged in the great cities, and circulate through many realms.
There are various other forms of coin, which have regional popularity, and will only be traded by certain folk.

Any listed price of an item in this reference is for a common form of the item in a populated area.
Note that buying used weaponry can be cheaper, but weapons purchased secondhand can be unreliable, and might need honing at a smithy.
Note also that these prices are typical in populated areas, but in small hovels, a weapon may be considered far more or less valuable, depending on if the seller knows the item's worth.

All equipment ***Encumbers*** a hero. The amount of Load a hero can carry is governed by their Strength.
A hero who is overencumbered cannot fight, and their Speed is halved, especially when travelling long distances.
A party might hire pack animals to carry a heavy load, or travel lighter than they might otherwise.

Most equipment is simple to calculate. One-handed items cost 1 Load. Two-handed cost 2.
50 Coins equals 1 Load, and precise things, like potions, cost 1 Load as well.
Other items are either outlined in these docs, or adjudicated on the fly.

***Pack Animals*** like
horses and mules can carry equipment long distances - either to bring tools to a dungeon, or to bring loot back home.

Weapons and armor which are damaged cannot be used, and must be ***Repaired*** by a professional with tools.

A character skilled in ***Foraging*** can make a check to find food and water once per day.
