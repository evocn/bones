OUT OF DATE!!! Read with caution...

## How does this whole fuckin thing come together?
### Long Ago
Long ago, the Myelar create the world. They hang out in this nice place they call Elturel.

Human Beings, originally from far, far away across the ocean and the mountains, migrate into the land of the Myelar.
They find a utopia! Inhabited by awesome elf people who have advanced technology!

The Myelar are benevolent, and let the people stay in their lands.
They don't understand eachother, you see, but the Myelar are friendly hosts.
They have nice feasts, and they hang out just fine. 
Some Myelar even teach some little secrets about magic and technology to the primitive humans.
Human Civilization in Elturel is the most advanced on the planet.

But at some point, things start to go bad. Some of the people start to get upset about the way the elves run the lands.
They start talking about the elves like they're proud or something, like they're making fun of the people.

To make matters worse, the elves start acting strange. Some of the elves start acting sort of like the people, being proud and taking things personally.
They worry about the people and their weapons, and start to think about kicking them out of their lands again.
But most of the elves still felt pretty generous, and it just didn't feel right kicking them out of this nice land.
Most of the people had come from lands which were war-torn and dangerous. This is a place where all these people could really get along.

Something changed one day when a person killed a Myelar for the first time.
It was a sin - an act of rage and malice, without justice behind it to motivate.

And while in life, the Myelar was a gentle sort of elf, with a kind spirit and goodwill towards his human neighbors,
when he fell, something terrible happened! A Myelar had never been killed in malice before, so they had no idea what would happen.
Out of his body sprang a wicked pox, a sickness which filled the air. It was like some evil thing was within him, and since he was a Myelar - so full of power - it was very strong.
The thing spread, methodically killing humans and scarring them with a black pus.
Worse, when they buried the dead humans and myelar elves, about a week later, they came back from the dead, as these wretched little things they called goblins or gremlins or shades.
They were insatiable to kill humans and elves alike - like they were driven by some anti-life spirit of death.

Eventually, the elves got the thing controlled, and tried to figure out what had caused it, but they were blind to their own feelings.
The corruption had already spread to all of them, and they couldn't clearly distinguish that they were upset. That they were mourning!

So crimes of this kind began to be more common, and people started to plan in big groups what kinds of things they were going to do to fight the Myelar.
There was eventually a big war, since the people wanted revenge, and so did the elves. They weren't that different in the end.
Pretty much everyone died, and it was even kind of close, since the Myelar were split between those that fought the humans and those which fought the corrupt elves.

Things were really pretty bad, so eventually, there was this big sacrifice where the Myelar kings shattered their crowns to seal the goblins underground,
destroy the darkness, and make a peace.
The Myelar gave up the west of Elturel for the people to live in, and made a bunch of mountains to keep the people out of the East.
They stayed away from eachother for a long time.

The West became this gnarly desert, where hardly anything grew.
It was hard for the people, but they learned how to live in the inhospitable environment.
Eventually, it had been long enough for the people to have forgotten the last war.
The Myelar and the Nefud (as they called themselves) became friends again. The Myelar gave them little gifts and stuff.
The Nefud, since they were so humbled by their environment, just appreciated it all. It was a good time.

But the Myelar saw things they feared. They were still sensitive.
So they were divided, eventually fighting among themselves.
The Goblin creatures they slayed in the last war all rose from the dead as soon as things got bad.
And the Myelar's powers were weaker than ever since they shattered the crowns.

Anyways, after a long civil war, the last remaining Myelar got together and made a plan.
They'd make the world hospitable for the human beings, and leave them the verdant lands of Elturel to live in.
They'd seal the darkness, and make everything right. Then, they would leave this world.

They did it, and only a few Myelar remained in the East, dedicated to being wardens over the darkness for humankind.

Eventually, the Nefud found that their Myelar friends were gone. They were sad and mourned for years. They told stories about the people.
But slowly they found their way to the East, where things were green and good.

They founded kingdoms in the old Myelar Citadels, and prospered for 1000 years.
Of course, they fought like people often do, but they did so in the ways of men, in familiar ways to our world.
And things slowly improved, like in our world, too.

### Recent History
So that peace lasted for 1000 years. The Myelar all went away back then, except a few stragglers, Myelar who were born near the end
who still had more to learn before they went on to the next life.
That's like what Asha is. She was born right after the Exodus, and she had to figure out life on her own.

So back to today.
We've got the Nefud in the West, in tribes, sticking it out in the Desert.
We've got the Four Kingdoms in Elturel, who each have their own history and quarrels and whatever.
There's even been some wars between the Nefud and the Kingdoms, but mostly the Precipice keeps them to themselves.
There's still some old wizards and magic-knowers who carry on the traditions of the Myelar, but their powers wane, and it's mostly a mundane world.
In the Nefud, there's still magic blood from the Myelar passed down by the Sorcerer Queens!

The people of both lands worship gods whose stories are sort of all tied in with the real-life history of the Myelar.
There's an order of paladins called the Knights of Torm, the Monks of the Moon, and some other groups with religious bent,
but for the most part folk care about their lives and try to keep their lords happy.

There was a big war about 50 years ago, when the folk of the Verdane tried to claim the Imperial Throne from the Reuss.
It was all orchestrated by the Marconi of the far East, but it all came to naught.
Lots of bloodshed, for nothing. Since then, it's been all peace and rebuilding. Swords to Plowshares and all that.

### The Inciting Incident
So about a decade ago, something really crazy happened. It sort of set off everything that is happening now.

There was a wizard who figured out what had happened to the Myelar. Who pieced together that they willingly disappeared.
That Wizard was called Neral, and he was one of the last remaining master wizards in the Four Kingdoms.

So he figured out what happened, and he got to thinking... What if the Myelar really should have had this land in the first place?
I mean, his reasoning made sense at the time, he was just thinking about how the human beings who live here now were sort of unwelcome,
and they didn't really have the right to kick the Myelar out the way they did.

He's sort of thinking about what it all means, when he meets this Myelar, the first one he's ever met.
The elf's name is Hyal. Hyal's a young Myelar, born after the Exodus, who has lived for 1000 years and watched the humans claim this land.

Hyal is sort of held against his will by Neral, though the two grow a sort of unsteady friendship.
Hyal is curious, and they have long discussions about what history means.
Neral is convinced that the Myelar have the right to this land. Meanwhile, Hyal doesn't really have a personal stake in the matter.

Eventually, Neral convinced Hyal to use his powers to connect to the souls of his ancestors, in the other world.
There, Hyal met his forefathers. The ones on the ledge between living and dead, in purgatory.
They told him to use Neral to try to reforge the Crown of Moonlight, to exterminate all the Goblins and reclaim Elturel for the Myelar.

So he returned to this world, sort of uncertain about what to do, but he grudgingly works with Neral on this reclaiming business.
They sort of investigate for a few years, then go off the grid. The last anyone heard of them, they were headed West.
No one knows what happened to those two.

Lady Cerwyn, the patron of Neral, discovered Neral's notes. She pieced together the same conclusions he did.
She brought this idea to the lords council of Errol, and even secretly to the Imperium.
She was generally rebuked, but many scholars began research into the documents Neral discovered.

It was at this point that Cerwyn was killed by Neral. Working through her as a puppet, Neral commanded the forbidden magic of possession
to use her power and influence to help him search for the keystone, hiring bandits across the world, both to help search and to spread disarray
among the kingdoms of men.

In the meanwhile, Neral and Hyal discovered that in order to return the Crown of Moonlight to power, they needed to release the seal.
Hyal refused, but Neral forced him to. Past the point of no return, Neral unleashed the evil sealed away in the far West of the World, and the Dark Beasts
began resurrecting the Goblins buried beneath the sand as shades, and spreading across the desert sands.

Meanwhile, Hyal managed to escape Neral's clutches. Blaming himself for what has happened, he set off to find the Crown of Moonlight, to seal the darkness.
By the time the party finds him, unconscious and nearly destroyed by darkness, He has found it, but it has come at a cost.

Anyways, the darkness spreads, and the Four Kingdoms find themselves utterly unprepared for it.

### Now
The Darkness has spread. Neral's forces grow across nearly all of Errol at this point.
Along their path, old Myelar strongholds have kept them at bay for short periods of time.
But an army of Shades grows across the Four Kingdoms.
The Nefud are almost completely swarmed, and only the Citadels survive in the vast desert.
Assistance is coming from the East, but is slow to arrive. The Four are in disarray, and communication is difficult.

The Party has, through either sheer luck or savvy, discovered half of the Crown of Light.
They set out from Helios to unite the halves and hopefully save the realm.
Eugenia the sorceress and Asha the Myelar hold great potential in their souls,
and their companions Lazarus the warrior and Alice the thief have been essential to their travels.
Lance, their elderly leader, has led them this far, but his old bones can only take him so far. This is most likely his final journey.

Hyal, retaining most of the Crown of Moonlight, has made his way to the Verdane of Errol, but has been corrupted by his journey.
The party, as we know, has found him outside the city of Helios.

They, along with Hyal, Ser Robin of Torm, and Leonster Fairheart of Helios, have set out to Maegor's Peak for their ultimate goal:
To save the world from Darkness!

### The Future
Neral and Sha'virr stand locked in battle over the Nefud desert.
Sha'virr will lose, and pass his powers on to Eugenia.

Neral will personally assault Maegor's Peak, and will stop the party from acquiring the Crown of Light.
Also Hyal will probably be kidnapped again, and turned into a godlike entity known as The Moonlight.

Eventually, the party will have to come up with some crafty way to defeat Neral and re-seal the darkness.
I want something which takes collaboration, coordination, and everyone's skills to do.
Like a real heist.

## Threads
Shar and Gascoigne are sworn to Eugenia's magical prowess.

Eugenia's magic becomes much stronger, and she finds that she is capable of teaching. This makes her a master.
* Sha'virr will pass his moniker on to her. "The Magi of the Rift"

Faisal and Pascal reach Aqia, and rally support to come to the group's aid on Maegor's Peak.

Neral and Sha'virr are locked in battle, but Sha'virr will lose eventually. Neral will have full reign, and it will be up to the party to stop him and the disease.

The Citadel of the Sun is the final destination for Asha - the place where Myelar go to pass on, and to leave this land to Humankind.

Important developments:
* Eugenia's powers need to begin to grow.
  * She can scry on the future in limited capacities.
  * She will learn DARK MAGIC in Neral's lair. Far more powerful spells that come at a cost.
  * Hold Person will get stronger too.

* Alice recieves word that her family might still be alive.
  * It's up to her whether to strike out on her own to try and save them.

# Items and Legends
# The Keystone
The old Kings of Myelar wore crowns made by the gods.
The Crowns of Light.

It is said that the old kings of Myelar brought enemies to their cause. They were invincible.
In times of darkness, the kings provided for all their subjects, and kept the darkness at bay.

# Goblins
Creatures of the Earth. They gave trouble to the Myelar in the days of sunlight.

# The Four Kingdoms
# Errol
#   The Precipice
# Khmer
A village of 150 people. Farmers.

## Walter, the Blacksmith
Walter Donavan is a middle-aged Lankhmari man with an old black cat and a hearty laugh.

He crafts horseshoes and plowshares for the local farmers, and hasn't touched a blade since he left his home kingdom.

He hails originally from the hold of Earthblade, where he was born and raised in peace-time, a smith since a boy.

Walter's stock is as follows:
Axe - 3 Gold
Sickle - 1 Gold
Smith's Tools - 3 Gold

For a custom request, he'll charge according to standard rates, with a 10% service charge.
He'll also hone or repair broken weapons and tools, for 1/4 the price of the item.

He'll charge a 1 Gold service fee for custom weapons and tools.

Walter keeps an apprentice, and spends the idle days teaching him. He's getting quite good, and Walter does little work these days.

## Averron, the Trader
Averron Hyde is a quiet, frail man, with an honest look in his eye.

He's lived a long life, and seen many of the cities of the West, though he has been retired here for as long as any can remember.

He tallies the taxes for the House of Errol here, and yet is still beloved by all - a feat!

Averron's stock consists of:
* 12 Torches
* 30 Day's sundries
* 4 Shovels
* 2 Sickles
* 1 Dull Axe, for half price.
* 2 Knives
* A knight's helm, embroidered with fineries. Underpriced at 7 Gold. He's had the thing for many years.

Averron has a wife, ***Leanna***, a scrawny woman with exquisite tastes,
and a child, Ellis, born from Leanna late in life. He's thirteen.

## Helen, the Tavern Keep
Tales are told of how Helen's husband died, and how she earned the honor of keeping the old road house,
but they are in hushed whispers, and kept far from Helen's bar.

She seats a dozen each night, with up to three times as many on weekends, and sleeps two in the unfurnished rooms below the house.
Helen tolerates no nonsense, dislikes rowdiness, and especially strangers - perhaps she's been burned too many times before.

But that hardness of heart is perhaps the only reason why Khmer can purchase wine
in such quantity and quality from Emory, and for that, the townsfolk look past
her unfriendly exterior.

She'll charge a Silver piece for a mug of ale and a decent meal, and a silver for two more mugs of ale after the first.

She permits a few cracks of life in this place, but otherwise she's a hard woman.

***Old John*** spends his days here, asleep in a rocking chair, and for an hour each night, he'll play the harmonica for you.
Helen lets him stay, free of charge. He's got no family to speak of, and his stories never quite add up.

***Wendy*** is a serving girl from a poor farmer's house. She sleeps upstairs.
She's never once allowed herself an aspiration, though perhaps could use for a bit of confidence - 
she's almost to shy to take orders from customers.

A few other regulars come here nightly, including Walter and Averron, who are good friends.
Others include...
* ***Reagan***, a boy enamoured with Wendy,
* ***Quill***, who is well-known as a cutpurse from Emory - hiding in plain sight, with a bribe to Helen to keep his place here from some unknowable stash of loot,
  He is in fact a member of the Shadow Guild, an order of honorable thieves across the Four.
* ***Tyrosh***, called such by his home city from the desert, who farms the green lands as good as any from Errol, but carries a bejeweled saber at his side at all functions,

## Captain Warren, of the Errol Guard
While at times Captain Warren will drink with his men and make merry, he takes his responsibility in Khmer very seriously.
He loves his men and the people of this town, and he does not make decisions lightly.

Once a promising tactician, meant for the knighthood. Assigned to Emory, and then to Khmer, due to disagreements with management.

Warren is a good-hearted man, but is not negotiated with, and does not believe in trading lives. He will avoid bloodshed at all cost.

His defense of the village of Khmer is an iron one, and the townsfolk are grateful for it, especially in light of recent threatening events.

The other men who fill out the four rooms of the Khmer Guardhouse are either locals or the less savory of their brothers in oath at the bigger cities.
Notable is 
* ***Oaf***, the deputy, who lives up to his name, and 
* ***Pascal***, an honorable servant of the House of Errol. Seeks the good of the people here.
* Otherwise, there's ***Ron***, and ***Little John***, a pair of local delinquents turned guards.

## Amos and Avery Baker, Hereditary bakers of the West of Errol.
The single most famous people in the village of Errol, and perhaps in Emory as well.

Their bread is the primary food of the people of the village, and the primary export of Errol.

Though their bread's quality is perhaps better explained by the freshness of the grain, by the nearness of its processing to its growing,
their craft is indeed a magic of its own.

They have ten children.
There are four girls besides Alice: Allie, Aggie, Annie, 
There are five boys, all named after famous Bakers: Alm, Amos Jr., Alexander, Atman, and young Andrew.
They also take care of their grandmother, Augustina.

***Andy*** will inherit the bakery, and has already her mother's talents. Alice... not so much.
Andy is married to ***Maurice***, a farmer who will take over the baker's trade soon.

## Sha'virr, Warlock of the Wastes.
Sha'virr is an old master of druid craft from the distant sands.

He lives near Khmer in a hollow tree stump. He works at strange potions and scrolls.
His apprentice is the hero Eugenia. He calls her by the Nafud term "Maia", meaning "Feminine one".

Soon after Eugenia leaves, he disappears, leaving only a note.
His mission is to investigate the magical imbalances in Umber, and elsewhere in the world.

# Blackstone Keep
Long ago, Blackstone Keep was a Wizard's hold called the ***Amber Keep***.
Now, it molds, and is home not to a master of magicks, but to a band known as the ***Blackbirds***.

# Fort Moonlight
An ancient castle of the Myelar.

Only two towers remain, half destroyed. All else is rubble.

## Rain
A mysterious Myelar.
Old and thin.
His knowledge is vast, as are his opinions.
He has seen many, many years.
The comings and goings of men. The risings and fallings of kingdoms. Now he is alone.
His powers wane in his old age, and he speaks dearly of swimming out to sea someday soon, but he has work yet to do.
The Spirit drew him here, and bade him guide the young Asha.

# Emory
A city, the biggest in the west. 3000 men live here, and their wives and children make near 10000.
Known for harvest, trade, and craft.
Well out of Errol, and thus a hub for outriding and smuggling, though small-time in nature.

Emory is a walled city, though they are short and thin walls, of wood. Like Jamestown.
Around the walls is a deep moat, carved long ago and filled regularly. It is squalid and thick-smelling.
There is a main drag, with a square and market stalls. There are homes along the edges, stacked well atop eachother.
Emory was rebuilt within recent memory, and old Emory stands to the south by a half dozen leagues, a ruin of a burning long ago.

The city's population is about a fifth Nafud folk, but mostly ancestral Errol folk.
They are mostly uneducated, peasants.

## Captain Moss, of the King's Guard
Captain Moss commands over 200 men in Emory, and near 400 in Western Errol, including the towns and the Farwatch.

He is a stern man. Humorless.
Sworn to the House of Errol.

Works as Cerwyn's hand, though covertly and in a small capacity.

## The Cran, Home of the Shadow Guild.
This place is the front of a legendary guild known as the Shadow Guild.
The business is in truth a brothel, but it also holds its secrets.

A band of mercenary outlaws. They do crimes, but only for the right cause, and the right coin both.
Harald, Doorman.
Kitty is the owner of the establishment, and is a cheerful, suggestive sort.

The Shadow Guild hideout is within one of the whore's rooms, behind a false panel in the closet.
You descend two stories of stone steps before arriving at a dirty door in the stone, which opens into a natural cavern.
A stream runs through the middle of this place, which is lit by torchlight.

*James* Is the primary Blackbird informer here.

## Donnel - Forge and Leatherworking
Donnel has most services for sale, and a great many good pieces here too.
He's the brother of Walter, from Khmer. They're both Lankhmari smiths, though Donnel has more chance to forge real steel.

## The Stone Bridge
The largest Inn in Emory beds up to 50, or near enough, and it does so cheaply.
The main selling point

*Orys* is the innkeep, a bawdy, raucous man with a booming laugh and a sharp tongue.
*Pot Boy* helps him.

Other travellers in the Stone Bridge include:
* *Lem*, a member of the Shadow Guild, working as a bard.
* *Trundle Gorm*, a sword hand for hire. He'll charge a silver a day to escort travellers.

* *Curtain Eater* Was the old leader of the bunch.

* *Gunther Trant*, a knight of House Trant, a local house of the Verdane.
* *Bram Jorah*, a knight of House Jorah, of Umber.

## The Fold of Chanterelle
This building holds the honor of being the largest in Emory, with a tall steeple four stories high, and a great bell exposed at the top.

the Priest here is named *Wendyn*, and he makes an effective sermon.
If he learns of Asha's growth powers, he will try to proclaim her as a prophet, and make for a big deal of it.
He is an honest enough man, seeking only to fill his bread bowl, and he tries to help the small folk.
There are a lot of poor people in this city, and they find hope in the promise of nature's bounty.

## Old Emory
A two-hour's walk from Emory, to the south.

It's a ruin, picked clean by looters over the fifty years since its destruction and abandonment.
The place was taken by the Blackbird bandits during the War of the Ninth Century.
King Warren and the Knights of Errol took the city back, and saved the people, but the city was destroyed.

That's the tale, but in truth, the city was retaken, and reconstruction began, but a dark spirit had inhabited the earth beneath the city, and the King had the city sealed.
The Crypt was sealed, with the great knights of the retaking buried beneath.
Among them was Robin Trant and his Knights of Glory.

## Prince Faisal
Faisal is the heir to the Katalon.
He is the last of the old blood of the west.

He seeks the keystone in the precipice and the lands beyond, as some way to ensure a future.
His mother had prophecied the thing, and he seeks it against his father's command.

Faisal made his way to Errol, but was unable to establish an audience with the King due to Lady Cerwyn.
He did, however, discover The Sorcerer Neral's prophecy, and attempted to return with that knowledge.
He was captured by the blackbirds before a chance encounter with the party, where they rescued him.
Captain Moss was ordered to ensure his return to his home country. However, the party ensured the prince's escape from Errol.
He returned to the Farwatch under the protection of Pascal, Guard of Errol.

## King Katalon

## Ayaz
A place which was once the Jewel of the Nafud.
The veritable Babylon of its time, it has fallen to ruin.
Now, the streets are filled with Shades, and its people scatter and hide.

Its location in the center of the Nafud once made it a hub for travel to all corners of the wastes.
Its single great well brought endless water to what most felt was a paradise among the sands.
But its time is come, and it is like any other ruined citadel.

# Aqia City
The furthest East of the great desert cities, Aqia is an independent mercantile city under the command of a rotating cabinet of merchant princes.
These princes generally descend from wealthy families, and broker power and wealth among themselves.
However, the council is sometimes called to discuss problems collectively.
They are called the Council of Aqia, and their judgements are absolute when unanimous.

## Shamir, Merchant of the Far West.
Though Shamir comes only from the nearby Oasis city of Aqia, Emory says Shamir is from the "Far West", a place he speaks of often and theatrically.

As for his living, he goes by the title of "Merchant", though selling his strange and unknown ware has never once brought him a profit.

His face is adorned with a constant, unfailing grin, alongside a deep gash of a scar through his top lip, all the way down to his now-forked tongue.

Shamir will sell all of the following, and is willing to haggle with someone who sees the futility of his sales here:
* An assortment of jambiya, the knife of choice in the Gray Wastes. He'll sell them for 1-4 Gold, depending on the make. The finest blades will earn respect among the desert folk.
* An El-Darakah, a kind of leathern shield which is light but extremely sturdy, going for 15 Gold in Emory, or so he says.
* A conical helm, meant to be worn under a turban. 7 Gold.
* A strange brew from the West - what he calls a "Miracle Cure", of murky green water. 5 Silver.
* A Recurve Bow of a hunter's make. Has a particularly light feel, and provides a +1 bonus to hit. 15 Gold.
* A lone Kindjal, a straight sword forged in the Desert Cities of the West. A fine blade, never dulled. 15 Gold.
* A makeshift compass, which is said to guide one to their true love. 1 Gold.

He travels his wares by Camel, an old, ragged thing, grateful for many days of travel in the Four Kingdoms ahead.

# Myelar
# Fort Moonstone
An old Myelar fortress in the foothills of Maegor's range on the Precipice of Errol.

The home of Rain, an ancient Myelar with a dutiful bent.
He stalls the darkness here, and will stand firm until he dies, protecting the realms of man.

# The Citadel of the Sun
The center of the Myelar's remaining power in this land.
It is invisible to the human eye.
It is located in the center of the continent, between the three human cities they call the Sisters.

Here there are a number of Myelar, who are dying slowly, blinking to preserve their longevity.

# Organizations
# The Shadow Guild
A brotherhood of honest thieves.
The Robin Hood types, but they take few jobs, and do not take any reward for their exploits.


# The Blackbirds
A band of brigands on the Precipice.
Covertly funded by the Marconi Family of the far east to investigate the supernatural claims of one of the last living sorcerers.

They are dead now.
Only Geoffrey remains, with a whip and a pike, and a broken arm, and Garreth, though he is a blackbird no longer.

## Geoffrey
Leader, built the Blackbirds from nothing. His tongue procures deals with lords, as well as the loyalty of his brigand brethren.
He is not a strong man, but his cruelty is feared. He's young.

## Garreth
an aging brigand, who did not always live this life. But a chance encounter with the law had him stripped of his knightly
valor and exiled to the gray wastes. A decade spent in the harsh sands weakened his resolve, and led him back to Errol, but as a brigand.
* He had a special connection with Alice.
* He has survived the battle at Blackstone Keep. He now wanders the wilderness in search of a new cause.

## Ronan
Was a shaggy-haired brute of a man, the brawn of the Blackbirds.
