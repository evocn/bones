An outline of what a player might expect in ***Lambda***.

# Priorities
The game I propose is a game in which...
> ***Decisions are more important than choices.***
The utmost care is taken to strip away everything which does not lead to some interesting consequence or implication.

> ***Heroes' true character is revealed.***
I tend to focus on choices which impact who a character is, and what they believe in.
I draw heavy inspiration from film.

> ***You will be challenged.***
I don't shy away from true consequences, character death, or permanent alteration.
We're playing a game.

> ***Tone matters.***
Everyone coming to the table contributes to the story being told.
We're all dedicated role-players, and we all want to string a tale which is compelling to participate in.
Consistency, dedication, and trust matter a lot at my table.

> ***Commitment is important.***
If we're going to pull a game like this off, we need all hands on deck!
I need 3-4 hours a week of time, though scheduling conflicts may occur.
What matters most is that when you come to my table, you are locked in, and laser focused.

# Gameplay
The game I'm interested in running involves three pillars of play: ***Exploration***, ***Combat***, and ***Social Interaction***.

The main essence of ***Exploration*** involves the mystery of an unknown world, and the promise of discovery.

> Exploration centers around character motivations and narrative. 
> For instance, your character might seek a long-lost blade of legend, and explore the world to find its resting place.

The main essence of ***Combat*** involves dramatic situations with outside-the-box approaches.

> Combat is loose, and dangerous. The enemies characters encounter might not be set up for them to win.
> Because of this, flat-out combat is rare, and short. Heroes, just like human beings, will probably be apprehensive about entering a fight, rather than circumnavigating it in some way.

> Characters have lots of options at their disposal. They must use these options carefully, or encounter defeat.

The main essence of ***Social Interaction*** is the natural dynamics of human relationships.

> This aspect of the game is not governed by mechanical systems, but is deeply ingrained in the core of the game.
> It's clear to me that we all care about this here.

# Rules
The game will use my custom system, ***Rubicon***, whose rules are found [here](/lambda/rules/).

***Notes on the rules***
* The system has no defined progression built in. Instead, progression is tied to goals.
* I use a flattened version of ability cooldowns called Skill Points (SP). Everyone has them, and they govern a character's ability to perform heroic feats like spells and special abilities.
* Encumberance is a pretty key aspect of the system. The game cares about load, travel time, and the like.
* The system is built around choice and tradeoff. Dump stats have consequences.
* There are only a few character archetypes at the outset. I tend to stick to the core archetypes: Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Cleric, Leader.
You will note, however, that within each are options which create specialization, and more will arise as the game is played.

# Length
The game I run tends towards discrete chunks, which I call ***arcs.***
The typical arc is 3 sessions.

To begin, I propose we play through one arc, and proceed from there.

# My Style
I tend to run fast and loose. Combats last less than 20 minutes. I expect players to be pretty active during play. The game should be nimble!

I like to run a game in-person, without miniatures. I like to play with music.

I tend to keep the dice off the table in most scenarios.
If a player comes up with a plan that seems very likely to succeed, I tend to not require dice.

My system is based on negotiation. Few actions have defined modifiers, but when you make a check, 
you make me a case as to which modifiers should apply.

# Tone and Setting
I want to run swords and sorcery fantasy, with the cinematic feel that epics tend to conjure up.
I want magic to be rare and mysterious. I want there to be unknown ruins in the untrodden wilderness holding untold secrets.

I want exploration, and especially combat, to be dangerous. I want death to loom around every corner.
I want the heroes to feel fear, to grapple with it, and to come out victorious at the end.

I want the heroes to grapple with their own motivations, and determine how they should act.
I want those motivations to be challenged by the danger the heroes feel.

I want characters to act in a reasonable and personal way to them, and in a way that a character of their world might.

I have no reservations about the gruesome, the grim, or the bleak.
However, I don't involve sexual violence in my game.
I aim to avoid all matters which would keep a player from authentically participating in my game.

I enjoy jokes, jests, and jibes, but I want my players to know that it's the exception, not the rule, at the table.
We're here to tell a story! We can talk and hang out before and after the session.
