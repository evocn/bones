<p>An outline of what a player might expect in <em><strong>Lambda</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="priorities">Priorities</h1>
<p>The game I propose is a game in which&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Decisions are more important than choices.</strong></em>
The utmost care is taken to strip away everything which does not lead to some interesting consequence or implication.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Heroes&rsquo; true character is revealed.</strong></em>
I tend to focus on choices which impact who a character is, and what they believe in.
I draw heavy inspiration from film.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>You will be challenged.</strong></em>
I don&rsquo;t shy away from true consequences, character death, or permanent alteration.
We&rsquo;re playing a game.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Tone matters.</strong></em>
Everyone coming to the table contributes to the story being told.
We&rsquo;re all dedicated role-players, and we all want to string a tale which is compelling to participate in.
Consistency, dedication, and trust matter a lot at my table.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Commitment is important.</strong></em>
If we&rsquo;re going to pull a game like this off, we need all hands on deck!
I need 3-4 hours a week of time, though scheduling conflicts may occur.
What matters most is that when you come to my table, you are locked in, and laser focused.</p>

<h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
<p>The game I&rsquo;m interested in running involves three pillars of play: <em><strong>Exploration</strong></em>, <em><strong>Combat</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Social Interaction</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The main essence of <em><strong>Exploration</strong></em> involves the mystery of an unknown world, and the promise of discovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exploration centers around character motivations and narrative.
For instance, your character might seek a long-lost blade of legend, and explore the world to find its resting place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main essence of <em><strong>Combat</strong></em> involves dramatic situations with outside-the-box approaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combat is loose, and dangerous. The enemies characters encounter might not be set up for them to win.
Because of this, flat-out combat is rare, and short. Heroes, just like human beings, will probably be apprehensive about entering a fight, rather than circumnavigating it in some way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Characters have lots of options at their disposal. They must use these options carefully, or encounter defeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main essence of <em><strong>Social Interaction</strong></em> is the natural dynamics of human relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This aspect of the game is not governed by mechanical systems, but is deeply ingrained in the core of the game.
It&rsquo;s clear to me that we all care about this here.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<p>The game will use my custom system, <em><strong>Rubicon</strong></em>, whose rules are found <a href="/lambda/rules/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notes on the rules</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The system has no defined progression built in. Instead, progression is tied to goals.</li>
<li>I use a flattened version of ability cooldowns called Skill Points (SP). Everyone has them, and they govern a character&rsquo;s ability to perform heroic feats like spells and special abilities.</li>
<li>Encumberance is a pretty key aspect of the system. The game cares about load, travel time, and the like.</li>
<li>The system is built around choice and tradeoff. Dump stats have consequences.</li>
<li>There are only a few character archetypes at the outset. I tend to stick to the core archetypes: Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Cleric, Leader.
You will note, however, that within each are options which create specialization, and more will arise as the game is played.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="length">Length</h1>
<p>The game I run tends towards discrete chunks, which I call <em><strong>arcs.</strong></em>
The typical arc is 3 sessions.</p>
<p>To begin, I propose we play through one arc, and proceed from there.</p>
<h1 id="my-style">My Style</h1>
<p>I tend to run fast and loose. Combats last less than 20 minutes. I expect players to be pretty active during play. The game should be nimble!</p>
<p>I like to run a game in-person, without miniatures. I like to play with music.</p>
<p>I tend to keep the dice off the table in most scenarios.
If a player comes up with a plan that seems very likely to succeed, I tend to not require dice.</p>
<p>My system is based on negotiation. Few actions have defined modifiers, but when you make a check,
you make me a case as to which modifiers should apply.</p>
<h1 id="tone-and-setting">Tone and Setting</h1>
<p>I want to run swords and sorcery fantasy, with the cinematic feel that epics tend to conjure up.
I want magic to be rare and mysterious. I want there to be unknown ruins in the untrodden wilderness holding untold secrets.</p>
<p>I want exploration, and especially combat, to be dangerous. I want death to loom around every corner.
I want the heroes to feel fear, to grapple with it, and to come out victorious at the end.</p>
<p>I want the heroes to grapple with their own motivations, and determine how they should act.
I want those motivations to be challenged by the danger the heroes feel.</p>
<p>I want characters to act in a reasonable and personal way to them, and in a way that a character of their world might.</p>
<p>I have no reservations about the gruesome, the grim, or the bleak.
However, I don&rsquo;t involve sexual violence in my game.
I aim to avoid all matters which would keep a player from authentically participating in my game.</p>
<p>I enjoy jokes, jests, and jibes, but I want my players to know that it&rsquo;s the exception, not the rule, at the table.
We&rsquo;re here to tell a story! We can talk and hang out before and after the session.</p>
