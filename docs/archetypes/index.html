<h2 id="wizard">Wizard</h2>
<p>A scholar of the arcane arts. Most wizards spend their days in a dark room, researching strange and ancient texts.
Others set out on the road in search of knowledge and to use their power to help people.
Some simply spend their days in meditation, among the woodland beings and the moon and stars.</p>
<p><img src="/lambda/images/wizard.jpg" alt="wizard"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this land, a Wizard is not just a college student who learned some spells. They are usually special individuals, with special destinies.
Long ago, Wizard was a title granted to members of a small society of heroes, who fought tyranny with their knowledge, and propelled us forth into the modern age.
For many years, Wizards kept the balance in the realm, never thinking of their own needs.
But over time, the purity of heart diminished, and in turn, the magic was lost.
When creating your wizard, consider what sort of things impel their spirits towards such ends, and what magic means to them.</p>
