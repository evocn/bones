      <description>OUT OF DATE!!! Read with caution&amp;hellip;
How does this whole fuckin thing come together? Long Ago Long ago, the Myelar create the world. They hang out in this nice place they call Elturel.
Human Beings, originally from far, far away across the ocean and the mountains, migrate into the land of the Myelar. They find a utopia! Inhabited by awesome elf people who have advanced technology!
The Myelar are benevolent, and let the people stay in their lands.</description>

      <description>The Twelve Tribes Katalon The Noble Tribe of the Nafud. Ever since the early days, since King Katalon, the First of His Name, united the Twelve Tribes under the Crown of the Sun, to drive back the invaders of the East, the Katalon have ruled the Council of the twelve tribes.
Their lineage is chock full of legends. Sorceresses, great Kings, God-Warriors, and Champions of Men. Today, the bloodline dwindles, the great City of Katalon sleeps, and dark tidings herald the end of the age of the Nafud.</description>

      <description>Archetypes Thief | Fighter | Leader | Wizard | Magi Below is a description of the traits and abilities of the five archetypes.
Thief An individual with particular skills.
A thief&amp;rsquo;s past is usually best forgotten, marred with mistakes or regrets. When creating your Thief, think about who they were before today.
Also note that while many are in it for the money, not every thief has the same ambitions. Some just wish to escape the squalor of the hand life has dealt to them.</description>

      <description>Generating Heroes Below is an outline of how to generate heroes for Lambda.
Choose an archetype. Familiarize yourself with your abilities.
Select your equipment. Heroes in this game start out poor. You get 10 Gold. Roll a d20. On a 20, you start with 20 Gold.
You can spend it on whatever you please, but I&amp;rsquo;d recommend getting a weapon and spending the rest on equipment.
You probably should save some, too, so you can buy food.</description>

      <description>Proposal Gameplay | Rules | Length | My Style | Tone and Setting An outline of what a player might expect in Lambda.
Priorities The game I propose is a game in which&amp;hellip;
Decisions are more important than choices. The utmost care is taken to strip away everything which does not lead to some interesting consequence or implication.
Heroes&amp;rsquo; true character is revealed. I tend to focus on choices which impact who a character is, and what they believe in.</description>

      <description>Rubicon Basics | Heroes | Combat | Equipment The Rules System for Lambda.
Priorities Rubicon is a system which is&amp;hellip;
Honest. Specialized heroes. Glaring weaknesses. Dump stats matter. Progression is specific. It is earned, not expected. Character death is possible, and in many circumstances probable.
Rules-light. Tight, simple core mechanic. Keep dice-rolling to a minimum. Rulings, not rules. Small numbers with big consequences. Simple, to allow for endless customization as a game progresses.</description>

      <description>The Setting The World | The Local Area | Reference This document outlines, in broad strokes, the setting that Lambda takes place in.
The World The Precipice is the name given to the strip of wilderness between the lands of the Four Kingdoms to the East, and the Free Cities to the West.
This is where our game takes place.
The Four Kingdoms lie on the green lands, where harvests are plentiful and nature&amp;rsquo;s bounty provides for the masses.</description>
